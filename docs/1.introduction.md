## Problem Statement

At Educloud Academy ([educloud.academy](https://educloud.academy)), we
specialize in teaching AWS Cloud Computing and Artificial Intelligence through
practical, hands-on workshops. Over time, we've developed extensive and diverse
content including:

- Text-based materials
- Rich visuals (Images)
- Informative and engaging Videos

However, we currently face two significant challenges that are hindering our
growth:

### 1. Marketing and Distribution

Despite producing high-quality, highly praised content, we struggle with
consistent and effective content distribution on social media platforms. This
inconsistency severely impacts our visibility and sales potential. While
reviewers frequently commend our content for its uniqueness, they often describe
our platform as "underrated" or hidden. Consistent content creation and social
media engagement are difficult tasks, consuming considerable time and resources,
which we currently lack.

### 2. Bilingual Content Delivery

Our second critical challenge arises from our recent outreach efforts at local
universities, specifically in Douala, Cameroon. Being situated in a bilingual
region, we've found that students, especially those from the Francophone
community, strongly prefer educational materials delivered in French rather than
English.

To effectively reach and engage both Anglophone and Francophone audiences, it’s
important that our content becomes fully bilingual. However, producing high
quality content in multiple languages consistently remains a considerable
hurdle.

In response, we've searched the market for applications capable of meeting these
requirements comprehensively. Unfortunately, we've found few platforms
adequately catering to our specific needs.But they aren't affordable at this
point for us.

Our ideal solution would be an app capable of intelligently consuming and
repurposing our existing content into engaging, multilingual social media posts
without compromising our content’s privacy and security. Ensuring our
proprietary workshop content remains secure, private, and under our direct
control is of paramount importance to us.

`Ukuaji` has been developed to meet exactly these unique challenges, ensuring
Educloud Academy achieves sustained growth, broader reach, and deeper engagement
with diverse audiences.

Also, we plan to make the app multi-tenant and privacy first to have other
organizations or individuals grow their social accounts or create unique content
for themselves as well.
